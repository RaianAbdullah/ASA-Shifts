# Deployment Guide

**Status: Stage 1 — Initial guide. Update as stages complete.**

## Replit Development Environment

The application runs automatically in the Replit preview.

- **Backend**: Spring Boot at `GET /api/healthz`
- **Mobile**: Expo app at preview root `/`
- **Database**: Replit managed PostgreSQL (available via `DATABASE_URL`)

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+ (`java -version`)
- Maven 3.9+ (`mvn -version`)
- Docker + Docker Compose
- Node.js 20+ and pnpm
- Expo Go app on iOS/Android device

### Steps

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <repo-url>
cd asa-workforce

# Start PostgreSQL and Redis
docker-compose up postgres redis -d

# Backend
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with local values
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=development

# Mobile (separate terminal)
cd artifacts/asa-mobile
pnpm install
npx expo start
```

## Environment Validation (Production)

The production application MUST fail to start when:
- `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` is missing or less than 64 characters
- `DATABASE_URL` is missing
- `ALLOWED_CORS_ORIGINS` is missing (no wildcard in production)
- `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=development` (dev mode in production is a security risk)

This validation will be added in Stage 4.
